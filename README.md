# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2024: Midterm Project

## Student Exam Performance Prediction

## Problem Description: 
The objective of this project is to build a regression model for predicting the United States high school students' mathematics examination scores (column: 'math score') to identify academically strong students prior to the examination.

If we can reach 80% accuracy at predicting students math exam scores during the proof of concept, the school will use this information to invite students to enroll in Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

## Dataset: 
**Source**: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)

**Description**:
This dataset describes the high school students from the United States (gender, race/ethnicity, parental background), the influence of other variables on students performance (lunch type, test preparation course), and their marks in various subjects (math score, reading score, and writing score).
